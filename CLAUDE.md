# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new or empty project directory. The repository currently contains no files or code structure.

## Getting Started

Since this is an empty project, future development will need to establish:

1. **Project Type and Technology Stack**: Determine what type of application this will be (web, mobile, desktop, etc.) and choose appropriate technologies
2. **Project Structure**: Create appropriate directory structure based on the chosen technology stack
3. **Build System**: Set up package management and build tools (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
4. **Development Workflow**: Establish linting, testing, and deployment processes

## Development Commands

No build, test, or development commands are currently available. These will need to be established based on the chosen technology stack.

## Architecture Notes

No architectural decisions have been made yet. This section should be updated once the project structure is established.
